Located in this "SupportFiles" directory are the scripts, config, and
media files required for the Pi_vit_eye program.

The .sh files are to be placed in ~/bin for the pi user.
The motion.conf file is to replace the default motion.conf file
located in /etc/motion.
The police_s.wav & bank_alarm_3.wav files can be found at 
www.freespecialeffects.co.uk/soundfx/sirens
They are referenced by SMSNotify.py.

If sound does not work, make sure user 'motion' has group 'audio' added.
